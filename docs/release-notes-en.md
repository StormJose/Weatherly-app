### üß† Architectural Changes
- Began migrating the app structure from basic HTML/CSS/JS to an **MVC architecture**.
  - Reorganized codebase to promote separation of concerns and reusability.
  - Logic is being refactored into standalone functions for better maintainability.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Migration is partial and ongoing. Expect full MVC support in the next version.

### üöÄ Tooling & Optimization
- **Integrated Parcel as the bundler**  
  Parcel is a zero-config build tool that simplifies bundling assets like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It optimizes performance, improves development workflow with hot reloading, and prepares the app for scalable deployment. As a multi-asset project with visual representations for all types of weather, it makes sense to move to a more sophisticated approach this time.

Thank you for checking out this release!  
Stay tuned for Version 1.2.0 where the MVC migration will be finalized and new features will be introduced.
